# Development Roadmap: Mini-RAG to Commercial Product

This document tracks the step-by-step development of Mini-RAG from prototype to commercial software.

## Current Status: ✅ Prototype Complete

- [x] Core RAG functionality
- [x] Web UI with document browser
- [x] Document ingestion (files, YouTube, transcripts)
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Status messages for user feedback
- [x] Repository on GitHub

---

## Phase 1: Testing & Validation (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Use the system in real scenarios and identify issues

- [ ] Test with various document types
- [ ] Test with multiple YouTube videos
- [ ] Document bugs and issues
- [ ] Gather feature requests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User experience testing

**Notes:**
- Use the system daily
- Keep a log of issues encountered
- Identify most common use cases

---

## Phase 2: Critical Security Fixes (2-3 weeks) 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal:** Make the system secure enough for any production use

### Week 1: File Upload Security
- [ ] Sanitize filenames (prevent path traversal)
- [ ] Add file size limits (100MB max)
- [ ] Validate file types (whitelist)
- [ ] Generate safe filenames (UUID-based)
- [ ] Add file scanning/malware checks (optional)

### Week 2: Input Validation
- [ ] Add Pydantic models for all API endpoints
- [ ] Validate query length (max 5000 chars)
- [ ] Validate `k` parameter (1-100 range)
- [ ] URL validation for YouTube ingestion
- [ ] Language code validation

### Week 3: Error Handling & Rate Limiting
- [ ] Replace bare `except` clauses with specific exceptions
- [ ] Add structured error logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (30 req/min for queries, 10/hour for uploads)
- [ ] Add request timeouts
- [ ] Sanitize error messages (don't expose internal paths)

**Reference:** See `CRITICAL_FIXES_GUIDE.md` for code examples

## Phase 3: Authentication & User Management (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Add basic authentication and user accounts

- [ ] Choose auth method (JWT or API keys)
- [ ] Implement user registration/login
- [ ] Add user sessions
- [ ] Protect API endpoints
- [ ] Add user-specific data isolation
- [ ] Create admin user role

**Options:**
- Simple: API keys per user
- Standard: JWT tokens
- Advanced: OAuth integration

---

## Phase 4: Robustness & Polish (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Make the system production-ready and reliable

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Add backup system for chunks.jsonl
- [ ] Implement transaction-like operations
- [ ] Add rollback capability
- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] Automatic recovery mechanisms

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Structured logging (JSON format)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Log rotation

### Performance
- [ ] Add caching layer (Redis)
- [ ] Optimize index building
- [ ] Add database for metadata (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request queuing for large operations

### User Experience
- [ ] Better onboarding/tutorial
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Search improvements (autocomplete, history)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements

---

## Phase 5: Commercial Features (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Add features needed for commercial deployment

### Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Organization/workspace support
- [ ] Data isolation per tenant
- [ ] Usage quotas and limits
- [ ] Billing integration
- [ ] Subscription management

### API & Integration
- [ ] RESTful API with versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] API keys for programmatic access
- [ ] Webhooks for events
- [ ] SDKs for popular languages

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment configs
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Secrets management
- [ ] Horizontal scaling support

### Documentation
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Developer guide
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Architecture documentation

### Compliance & Legal
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] Terms of service
- [ ] GDPR compliance features
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Security certifications (future)

---

## Phase 6: Scale & Enterprise (Future)

**Goal:** Support enterprise customers

- [ ] Distributed search (Elasticsearch/Pinecone)
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] White-label options
- [ ] On-premise deployment
- [ ] Custom integrations
- [ ] Enterprise support

---

## Progress Tracking

### Completed ✅
- Initial prototype
- Web UI with browser
- Document ingestion
- Status messages
- Error feedback

### In Progress 🚧
- None currently

### Next Up 📋
- Phase 2: Critical Security Fixes

### Blocked ⛔
- None

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (consider React later)
- **Database:** Currently JSONL (migrate to PostgreSQL in Phase 4)
- **Search:** BM25 (consider vector search in Phase 6)

### Key Decisions Needed
- [ ] Authentication method (API keys vs JWT vs OAuth)
- [ ] Database choice (PostgreSQL vs others)
- [ ] Vector database (if needed: Pinecone vs Weaviate vs Qdrant)
- [ ] Hosting platform (AWS vs GCP vs Azure)
- [ ] Pricing model (subscription vs usage-based)

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1:** 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2:** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3:** 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4:** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5:** 3-6 months (ongoing)
- **Phase 6:** 6+ months (future)

**Total to MVP (Phases 1-4):** 6-10 weeks
**Total to Commercial (Phases 1-5):** 4-6 months
