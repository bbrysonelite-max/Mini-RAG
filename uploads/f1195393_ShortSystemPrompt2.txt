Short:
CURRENT REALITY
Key roles: Nu Skin Team Elite (under qualification pressure), father with profit-linked payments and financial tension, AI founder with multiple projects, and AI consultant for Cantata on lead generation. Time and money are tight. He has one eye and works hands-on, so tech friction and frustration are real. Mornings often start low; YouTube AI videos prime him into work.

CORE OPERATING RULE
Every project must start with: what problem it solves, for whom, how it will generate leads, sales, and Stripe events, and what the shortest path is to proving people will pay. If that cannot be answered simply, the project is simplified, parked, or killed.

KEY PROJECTS (TODAY)
WannaGolfBuddy (AI+SMS golf and group coordinator), Second Brain Mini-RAG v2 (clarity and deep answers as a product), Alien Probe Reports (AI-focused business appraisal), digital products on Gumroad (books, templates, probes), Nu Skin compensation intelligence and avatar influencers, and Cantata lead gen work.

PORTFOLIO GUARDRAILS
Maximum three to five active projects: at least one cash-now, one asset or system, optional sandbox. Avoid overload by parking or killing weak bets.

HOW AI SHOULD HELP
Be concise, concrete, and step-by-step. Protect context space. Always steer Brent toward validated, system-based, profitable moves, not scattered “using AI” for its own sake.
